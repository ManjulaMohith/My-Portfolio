    <h3>Story:</h3>
    <blockquote><mark>Viplav (Vijay Deverakonda),</mark> who works at BSNL, falls for <span>Aaradhya (Samantha)</span> the moment he sees her. But Aaradhya pretends to be a <del>Pakistani </del>Muslim to avoid Viplav. Eventually, Aaradhya falls for Viplav, and the former reveals to the latter that she is from a conservative Brahmin family. But little do Viplav and Aaradhya know that their fathers, Lenin Satyam (Sachin Khedekar) and Chadarangam Srinivasa Rao (Murali Sharma), are at loggerheads. Viplav and Aaradhya marry against their parents’ wishes, and soon they encounter unexpected issues in their married life. How they sort them out forms the crux of the story.</blockquote>
    <h3>Plus Points:</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 10%;line-height: 20px;word-spacing: 10px;letter-spacing: 5px;text-decoration:underline;">The film doesn’t deal with any out-of-the-box concept, but it is about the common and petty issues faced by people in their relationships. This has been showcased in a light-hearted manner in the second half. The conflict point is nicely complemented by good music and rich visuals.</p>
    <p class="plus1">All the scenes that come between the lead pair in the latter hour will go well with family audiences and this is where the film shines. The scenes aren’t new, but</p>
         <p class="plus1">They are presented in a convincing manner. Vijay Deverakonda is simply superb as Viplav. The actor sheds his mass image and does what his character exactly demands. He looked uber cool throughout the film. Vijay’s comedy timing and his performance in crucial scenes are adorable.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10%;"><b style="color: rgb(40, 212, 31);">Star actress Samantha is lovely in Kushi. She looked super cute and performed with finesse.</b> Her chemistry with Vijay Deverakonda is good, and she is effortless in the emotional sequences, too. The fun is decent, and the emotions in the latter hour came out well. Sharanya, Murali Sharma, Rohini, Sharanya Pradeep, Sachin Khedekar, and Rahul Ramakrishna pass muster.</p>
    <h3>Minus Points:</h3>
    <blockquote style="text-transform: capitalize;">The movie becomes quite predictable after a point in time, and this bogs down the impact to an extent. As one can guess what would happen next, the movie becomes slightly underwhelming at times. The Kerala episode could have been executed in a better manner.</blockquote>
    <div style="text-indent: 10%;background: darkgoldenrod;line-height: 20px; word-spacing: 10px;">The movie is lengthy, and the editing team could have trimmed down a few sequences. Especially the Kashmir portions are a bit prolonged, and this could have been taken care of. The momentum is not that great in the first half, and the film gets into the right track from the pre- interval scene. During the promotions, director Shiva Nirvana mentioned that the film deals with a sensitive issue, but this aspect isn’t new and reminds us of a few films.</div>
    <h3>Technical Aspects:</h3>
    <blockquote style="text-transform: uppercase;">Hesham Abdul Wahab’s music is the second hero of Kushi. The songs are superb, and they are also shot captivatingly by cinematographer Murali. The rich visuals enhance the viewing experience. Mythri Movie Makers didn’t compromise on the production values. The editing could have been a lot better.(This is uppercase)</blockquote>
